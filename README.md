# <b>The Quote Machine</b>
An API for your next quote project.

## ways through which you can contribute:
<ul>
    <li>Update quotes.json , with new quotes, and create a Merge Request.</li>
    <li>Work on frontend , I am very much satisfied though, but this is made just by using HTML & CSS, I wonder, if this could be better.</li>
    <li>quotes are just from one source yet, change quotes.json and backend to make it more inclusive for other authors.</li>
</ul>
